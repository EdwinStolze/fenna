/**
 * This is the email template used by the 'Autoresponder' feature in Form Builder
 *
 * CUSTOMIZE
 * =========
 * To customize this email, copy this file to /site/templates/FormBuilder/email-autoresponder.php and modify it as needed.
 * To make it just for a one form, name it email-autoresponder-myform.php, replacing "myform" with form name.
 * It's preferable to do this so that your email template doesn't get overwritten during FormBuilder upgrades.
 * Inline styles are recommended in the markup since not all email clients will use <style></style> declarations.
 *
 * VARIABLES
 * =========
 * @var array $values This is an array of all submitted field values with ('field name' => 'field value') where the 'field value' is ready for output.
 * @var array $labels This is an array of all field labels with ('field name' => 'field label') where the 'field label' is ready for output.
 * @var array $formData Raw form data array, which is the same as $values but unformatted and with additional properties like 'entryID' and '_savePage' id.
 * @var string $body Optional body text for email, if provided. 
 * @var string $subject Subject line for email, if needed. 
 * @var InputfieldForm $form Containing the entire form if you want grab anything else from it.
 * @var FormBuilderEmail $formBuilderEmail Instance of FormBuilderEmail that is sending the message.
 * @var string $emailField Name of field in form that auto-responder email address came from.
